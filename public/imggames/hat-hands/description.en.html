<h2>Tips and Tricks for Hat Hands</h2>

<p><strong>1. Master the Bounce Timing:</strong> Watch how each platform moves. Jump when it's at its highest point to reach faraway ledges easily. Hold your jump button a little longer for extra lift to gather those hard-to-reach collectibles.</p>

<p><strong>2. Snag Sparkling Tokens:</strong> Look out for the flashing gems scattered around each stage. Collecting them not only boosts your score, but it can also unlock colorful new hats that give your hero special powers.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use Spring Pads Wisely:</strong> Brightly colored launch pads can help you jump higher or across wide gaps. Aim for the center of each pad for the smoothest ride. Getting too close to the edge might send you off course!</p>

<p><strong>4. Hunt for Secret Doorways:</strong> Sometimes a hidden panel or cracked wall leads to bonus rooms filled with extra lives, stacks of tokens, or mini-challenges. Tap every suspicious block to find shortcuts and sneaky surprises.</p>

<p><strong>5. Swap Hats to Suit Your Style:</strong> Different hats offer more than just a cool look. Try the Feather Cap for extra airtime or the Steel Bowler to withstand gusty winds. Switching hats between levels can make tricky sections much easier.</p>

<p><strong>6. Track Your High Scores:</strong> Check the in-game scoreboard after each level to see how you rank with friends. Aiming for the top spot adds fun and helps you find clever routes you might have missed.</p>

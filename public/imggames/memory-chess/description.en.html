<p>Tap or click the first card to turn it over and see which piece is hiding. Then choose a second card and flip it too. If they're the same piece, they stay face-up—hooray! If not, they'll flip back down in a moment.</p>

<h2>Sharpen Your Memory</h2>

<p>Pay close attention to where each piece appears. Try to remember cards you've already seen to uncover pairs faster.</p>

<h2>Finish with a Winning Time</h2>

<p>Keep going until every pair is matched and no cards remain face-down. Challenge yourself to beat your personal best time and watch your memory skills soar!</p>

<h2>Quick Tips for Super Success</h2>

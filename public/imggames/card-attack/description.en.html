<h2>How to Play Card Attack</h2>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>First, each player—both you and the computer—starts with five cards and 20 health points. When it’s your turn, click the big “Draw” button to add a new card to your hand.</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Choose an Attack card to hit your opponent. The number on the card shows how many health points you will take away from them.</li>
  <li>After your attack, make sure you have only five cards in your hand by discarding any extras.</li>

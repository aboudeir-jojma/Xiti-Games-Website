                  <h3>‚ö°How to Play Liquid Sort</h3>
                  <p>Getting started with Liquid Sort is as easy as pouring water! You‚Äôll see a bunch of test tubes, each holding a mix of colorful liquids. Your job is to move the liquids so each tube contains only one color.</p>

                  <h3>1. Look for Same Colors</h3>
                  <p>Tap a tube to pick up its top liquid layer, then tap another tube to pour it in. You can pour only if the colors match or if the destination tube is empty and has space.</p>

                  <h3>2. Use Empty Tubes Wisely</h3>
                  <p>Empty tubes are your helpers. Keep at least one free tube so you can shuffle liquids around. This little trick helps you avoid getting stuck.</p>

                  <h3>3. Plan a Few Moves Ahead</h3>
                  <p>Before you pour, think: ‚ÄúWhich color should go first?‚Äù This will save you from messy mixes and dead ends.</p>

                  <h3>4. Stack Neatly to Clear Levels</h3>
                  <p>When all tubes hold just one color, you've beaten the level! The puzzle clears, and a new, trickier level unlocks.</p>

                  <h3>5. Tips for Tiny Puzzle Masters</h3>
                  <p>
                  ‚Ä¢ Start with colors that appear least often‚Äîthis creates space.<br>
                  ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt pour if there‚Äôs no matching color underneath; you might block a move.<br>
                  ‚Ä¢ Take your time and enjoy the colorful stacks!

<h2>How to Play UNO</h2>

<p>UNO is an exciting card game that children can learn in just a few minutes and enjoy for hours. The main goal is to be the first to get rid of all the cards in your hand. Follow these easy steps to start playing:</p>

<h2>1. Get Ready</h2>
<p>Deal seven cards to each player. Place the remaining deck face down in the center. Turn over the top card to begin the discard pile.</p>

<h2>2. Match and Play</h2>
<p>On your turn, look at the top card in the discard pile. You can play a card that matches the color (red, yellow, green, or blue) or the number (0-9). If you have a matching card, place it on top, and your turn ends.</p>

<h2>3. Use Action Cards</h2>
<p>Here's what each action card does:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skip card: The next player misses their turn.</li>
  <li>Reverse card: The playing order reverses direction.</li>
  <li>Draw Two card: The next player draws two cards.</li>
  <li>Wild card: You choose the color for the next turn.</li>
  <li>Wild Draw Four: You choose a color, and the next player draws four cards (use this card only if you don't have a matching color).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What If You Can't Play?</h2>
<p>If you can't play a card, draw one from the deck. If it fits, you can play it immediately. If not, keep it and wait for your next turn.</p>

<h2>5. Shout “UNO!”</h2>
<p>When you have only one card left, yell “UNO!” If you forget and someone catches you, draw two penalty cards.</p>

<h2>6. Winning the Game</h2>
<p>Keep taking turns, matching and discarding cards. The first player to discard all their cards wins!</p>

<h2>Tips for Families and Friends</h2>
<p>Encourage fair play and friendly cheering. Practice recognizing colors and numbers to speed up turns. Use action cards wisely to surprise your opponents!</p>

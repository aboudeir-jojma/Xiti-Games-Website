                          <p>Get ready to build the coolest little city ever with City Blocks! This easy-to-learn block puzzle is perfect for kids who love colorful shapes and smart challenges.</p>

                          <h3>Drag and Drop Your Blocks</h3>
                          <p>On the right side of the screen, you‚Äôll see different block shapes. Click (or tap) one, then drag it onto the empty grid in the center. You can rotate your shape before placing it, so it fits just right.</p>

                          <h3>Complete Rows and Columns</h3>
                          <p>Your mission is to fill every square in a row or column‚Äîno holes allowed! Once a full line is formed, it magically clears away and you earn points. The more lines you clear at once, the bigger your bonus!</p>

                          <h3>Plan Ahead to Keep Going</h3>
                          <p>Keep an eye on the next three blocks waiting for you. Think about where each one will go so you don‚Äôt block your own space. If there‚Äôs no room for a new block, the game is over‚Äîso smart positioning is key!</p>

                          <h3>Rack Up High Scores</h3>
                          <p>Chain reactions are where the real fun starts. Clearing one line might cause blocks to fall into place and complete another line right away, racking up extra points. Aim for those combos to climb the leaderboard!</p>

                          <h3>Tips for Tiny City Planners</h3>
                          <p>- Start with the largest shapes first to avoid tight spaces.</p>
                          <p>- Leave a gap or two in the middle so you can slot smaller blocks in later.</p>
                          <p>- Watch your score multiplier‚Äîit grows each time you clear lines in a row!</p>

                          <p>Jump in now and see how big your mini-metropolis can grow. City Blocks turns simple drag-and-drop action into a colorful block puzzle adventure‚Äîperfect for budding architects and city builders of all ages!</p>

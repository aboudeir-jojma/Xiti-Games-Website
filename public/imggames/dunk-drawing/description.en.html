<h3>How to Play Dunk Drawing</h3>
<p>Get ready for Dunk Drawing, the fun basketball game where your drawings make points! Your mission is simple: draw a path to guide the ball right into the hoop. Here’s how to play:</p>
<p>1. Click or tap and hold anywhere below the bouncing ball.</p>
<p>2. Drag your finger (or mouse) to make a line, curve, or ramp.</p>
<p>3. Let go and watch your drawing send the ball rolling, bouncing, or flying toward the basket.</p>
<p>Remember, each puzzle level gives you only one try to draw, so design your ramp with care. A steep ramp might make the ball fly past the hoop, while a gentle slope might not make it reach. Your goal is to make that perfect basket before your turn ends!</p>
<h3>Tips for Young Artists</h3>
<p>• Try different curve shapes—sometimes a little bend makes a big difference.</p>
<p>• Start simple: a straight ramp often works best on early levels.</p>
